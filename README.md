# ssl_cacert_hack

This cookbook updates CA Bundles that are included with other software.

There are better ways to add trusted certificates to your system CA store, such as the [trusted_certificate](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/trusted_certificate) cookbook.  You should probably be using one of those.  This cookbook is a sledge hammer approach.

You have been warned.
